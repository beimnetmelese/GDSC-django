Create a Python script that identifies and collects files (both created and modified) in the last 24 hours from the current directory. Update these files in some way and move them to a folder named "last_24hours."

Requirements:

Listing Files:
Use the os module to list all files in the current directory.
Identification of Files:
Implement a function to determine whether a file has been created or modified in the last 24 hours.
Consider both the modification time (st_mtime) and creation time (st_ctime) of the file.

Update Files:
Create a function to update the identified files. For example, append a timestamp to the content of each file.

Create "last_24hours" Folder:
Check if a folder named "last_24hours" exists. If not, create it using the os module.

Move Files:
Move the identified and updated files to the "last_24hours" folder using different method
Combine the functions to achieve the main objective.
